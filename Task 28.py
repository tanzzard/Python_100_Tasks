if 2 + 2 != 4: 
    print("2 + 2 is 4") 
#The code provided contains an if statement, but it appears to be structured incorrectly. 
#The condition 2 + 2 != 4 evaluates to False because 2 + 2 is equal to 4. 
#As a result, the code block inside the if statement, which contains the print statement, will not be executed.
